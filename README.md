Good afternoon everyone, I am Nitin , Aarav,... we are the members of Group-3 and today we stand before you to shed light on a pressing issue that affects us all in this digital age – the right to privacy in the realm of social networking apps. The young generation,as we are popularly known, is the one that accounts for the maximum number of users for numerous social media handles and websites. The number is similar on the reverse side as well. Only a negligible fraction of us are not present on the social networking apps. Social networking apps have become an integral part of our lives, allowing us to connect, share, and communicate with others effortlessly. But as we immerse ourselves in the world of online connectivity, it is crucial to understand the implications of our actions and the potential risks we face when it comes to safeguarding our personal information. We must understand that this luxury comes at a cost – the potential compromise of our privacy. While these platforms offer us a sense of community and belonging, it is essential to recognize the challenges they pose to our fundamental right to privacy. And so my teammates would further elaborate the topic.
